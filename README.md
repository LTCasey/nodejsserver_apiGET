This is a ChatGPT response, there will be a better wiki later...maybe. 

Certainly! Here's an updated GitHub README that includes information about setting up your Node.js server using Axios, Express, and CORS, based on your `server.js` file:

# Node.js Server with Axios, Express, and CORS

This repository demonstrates how to set up a Node.js server using Axios for API requests, Express for routing, and CORS for handling cross-origin requests. It includes a simple web page (`index.html`) with associated CSS (`styles.css`) for frontend display.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LTCasey/ramble.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-nodejs-server
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install axios cors express
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

Start the Node.js server:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will be running on port 3000 by default, but you can change the port in `server.js` if needed.

### Enabling CORS

This server uses the CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests. You can customize CORS options in `server.js` as needed, or restrict access by specifying origins.

### Accessing the Web Page

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see a simple web page displaying data fetched from an API.

### Customizing the API Endpoint

In `server.js`, you can customize the API endpoint you want to fetch data from by changing the `apiEndpoint` variable. Replace it with your desired endpoint URL.

### Customizing the Frontend

- `index.html` contains the structure of your web page. You can modify it to match your design.
- `styles.css` contains the CSS styles for your web page. Customize it to change the visual appearance.
